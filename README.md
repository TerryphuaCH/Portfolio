# Terry's Portfolio

This is where I introduce myself and have features about me in the website, informations including my achievements, hobbies and a summary about me and my interests as well. 
 
## Design Process

I made the design this website is specifically targeted for people who might be intersted if they want to get to know me more in depth or for future companies to easier reach out to me if nessacory.

I made it simple because I like to keep things simple and if I make it too complicated, companies might find it difficult to navigate around in the website.

The wireframe shows that most of the layout is the same because of the simplicity and I hope to add more features in it to make it nicer and better.

## Features

There is a contact me page where there is a feature where users can key in their contact informations and it would be stored at the cloud, allowing me to contact them in future if need.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users to fill in details to contact me.
