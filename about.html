    <p>My name is Phua Cheng Hong Terry from Fuchun Secondary School. I am kind and cordial to my classmates and the people around me. I will always lend a helping hand to people who need help, be it academically or other areas. I am a student councillor and camp instructor in school. I was also selected to participate in events such as a Closed-door Dialogue with PM Lee Hsien Loong, National School Games as a price steward and an organiser for my school camp. I am able to carry out tasks independently with minimal supervision and produce excellent results. I am receptive to feedback and also show willingness to work on areas where I can improve on.<br><br>
    I personally enjoy doing VIAs, helping out with school events. Outside of school, I do consoles, Phone, Computer or even laptop repair be it software or hardware. I do diagnostic test for people as well. I have been trying to learn to code as well, I have used programs such as Python, Stack OverFlow, Putty, SHSH. <br><br>
    Other than technologies, I enjoys exercising as well, every week, I would at least cycle or swim twice a week. As I believe keeping a healthy lifestyle is beneficial to my mind and body as well. Keeping in touch with my family is also important, though my parents and siblings are working during weekdays, we always come together every weekend and catch up with each other.<br><br>
