        <h4>STUDENT LEADER/<br>CAMP INSTRUCTOR</h4>
        <p>
  Being a student councillor in my school has enabled me to help the school and its staff in school activities, occasions and the execution of school activities. 
  <br> It has nurtured me to grow and develop as a better leader and to exercise voice and choice more effectively. Beside being a student leader, I was also a camp leader. 
  <br>Although a camp leader has many responsibilities such as having to to plan and help with school events such as cross countries, inter-class games or any major events hosted by the school, 
  <br>I was able to adapt to changes, learn from my mistakes and most importantly, grow in the journeys and events. One of the responsibilities I had as a camp leader was to organise a field event in which I have to help with the getting of equipment, 
  <br>assignation of roles to people and plan the entire procedure.</p>

        <h4>VALUE IN ACTION (VIA)</h4>
        <p><br>Being a student has enabled me to participate in VIAs. I visited the elderly at community clubs or nursing homes and spent time with them, be it communicating or simply being a listening ear to them. I have also delivered bags of food to elderly living in one-room flats, befriending them with the intention to ease their loneliness. From all the VIAs I have participated in, I have learnt to speak confidently and be an effective communicator, deepening my social and civic responsibility. In school, I played the role of the God of Fortune where I guided the elderlies in the school and took care of them during the Chinese New Year celebration. They were very happy when they saw a young God of fortune. Their smiles brought so much joy and comfort to me.</p>
