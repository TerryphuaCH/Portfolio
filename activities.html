        <h4>STUDENT LEADER/<br>CAMP INSTRUCTOR</h4>
        <p>
  Being a student councillor in my school has enabled me to help the school and its staff in school activities, occasions and the execution of school activities. It has nurtured me to grow and develop as a better leader and to exercise voice and choice more effectively. Beside being a student leader, I was also a camp leader. Although a camp leader has many responsibilities such as having to to plan and help with school events such as cross countries, inter-class games or any major events hosted by the school, I was able to adapt to changes, learn from my mistakes and most importantly, grow in the journeys and events. One of the responsibilities I had as a camp leader was to organise a field event in which I have to help with the getting of equipment, assignation of roles to people and plan the entire procedure.</p>

        <h4>VALUE IN ACTION (VIA)</h4>
        <p><br>Being a student has enabled me to participate in VIAs. I visited the elderly at community clubs or nursing homes and spent time with them, be it communicating or simply being a listening ear to them. I have also delivered bags of food to elderly living in one-room flats, befriending them with the intention to ease their loneliness. From all the VIAs I have participated in, I have learnt to speak confidently and be an effective communicator, deepening my social and civic responsibility. In school, I played the role of the God of Fortune where I guided the elderlies in the school and took care of them during the Chinese New Year celebration. They were very happy when they saw a young God of fortune. Their smiles brought so much joy and comfort to me.</p>
